The humanitarian community has long known this and has increasingly tried to incorporate in emergency programmes the particular needs of women, the elderly, persons with a disability and marginalised groups.\\n Greater effort needs to be made, however, to enable marginalised affected and at-risk communities to play a stronger role in disaster prevention processes and in accountability in response. As a bare minimum, donors and national governments should support nuanced programming approaches that are sensitive to vulnerable and marginalised community members. Local and national actors that have a greater understanding of local communities and social norms can play a key role in identifying socio-cultural dynamics.\\n In Christian Aid’s experience, working with communities and local and national partners in areas of disaster risk as part of a longer-term approach to resilience-building and risk management is the most effective way of enabling communities to discuss and identify issues of vulnerability and marginalisation. This process is sometimes even more effective if communities are brought together with a range of stakeholders, including specialists in supporting the particular needs of vulnerable and disaster-affected populations, to identify appropriate mitigation and response plans.', 'topic': '8 - Gender', 'Region': 'Global Documents', 'subtopic': '8C.\\tGender equality programming including gender analysis and needs assessment:', 'page': 13}\n",
